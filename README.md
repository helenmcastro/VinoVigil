## Problem 
Disease in wine grape crops can cost United States growers billions of dollars each year.

Detecting the presence of a virus or bacteria can be costly, too and in some cases, visual signs of disease aren't obvious until a year after an infection occurs. At that point, it can be too late to save the diseased vines.
